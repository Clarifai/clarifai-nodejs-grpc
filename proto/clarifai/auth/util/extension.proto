  // For each grpc method we define a list of required low-level auth scopes that are needed

  // request as one of the first things in the life of a request once it reaches out API
  // servers. There are additional checks for each scope when the resource is used throughout the
  // backend in order to protect that resource. For example, Inputs_Add protects the writes to the
  // inputs DB table. Since we know every PostInputs call needs to do that, we add Inputs_Add scope
  // to the cl_depending_scopes list for the PostInputs method.
  //
  // This is only checked valid when used with KeyAuth cl_auth_type.

  // This should be the absolute minimum required scopes to make API calls with the method
  // that this options is used for. If there are some scopes that are needed some of the time
  // depending on the request, then leave those out as they will be checked at the tighest
  // possible portion of the codebase to protect that resource and won't effect every API call. For
  // example, the PostAnnotations call is often used to add concepts as well. If those concepts are
  // new, then the Concepts_Add scope will be needed. But since you don't always annotate with
  // concepts, it is not a hard requirements that Concepts_Add is used.
